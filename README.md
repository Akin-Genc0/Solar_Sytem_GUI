# Solar System Simulator  

A **solar system simulation** that visualises the orbits of **Mercury**, **Venus**, **Earth**, and **Mars** around the sun, along with their moons orbiting the respective planets. This project was created to enhance my **Java** and **JavaFX** skills, focusing on **object-oriented programming**, **dynamic animations**, and **graphical rendering** in a simple, interactive interface.

## Features

- **Planetary orbits**: Simulates the orbits of **Mercury**, **Venus**, **Earth**, and **Mars** around the sun.
- **Moons in motion**: Includes the **Moon** orbiting Earth and **Deimos** orbiting Mars.
- **Realistic animations**: Watch planets revolve around the sun and satellites orbit their planets.
- **Interactive controls**: Start and stop the animation with easy-to-use buttons.
- **Position tracking**: Displays the real-time position and angle of each planet and satellite in the right-hand panel.
- **Expandable system**: Easily add new planets or moons by updating the code.

## Technologies Used

- **Java** for core functionality  
- **JavaFX** for GUI and animations  
- **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)** for modular, reusable code

## How to Use

1. Click **"Start Animation"** to begin the simulation of planetary orbits.
2. Click **"Stop Animation"** to pause the movement of the planets and moons.
3. View the **right-hand panel** to see real-time information about each planet's position and angle.
4. Add more planets or moons by modifying the `SolarSystem.java` file.
